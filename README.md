## Getting started

- Clone the repository then write `npm i`
- after `npm i` write `npm run dev` to run server local

### Available tasks

These scripts can be run by `yarn SCRIPT_NAME` or `npm run SCRIPT_NAME`. They're available in `package.json` with key: `scripts`

- `snowpack` copies the scripts you configure from `node_modules` to `web_modules`. You will need to run this command every time you install a new dependency
- `test` run the workflow unit tests. You probably will need to override this with your own tests.
- `dev` starts the development server.
- `build` run the necessary scripts to build your application.

## Todo

- Write better documentation for getting started.
- Cache busting for scripts written by developers.
- Support for WebP and options to generate them automatically.
